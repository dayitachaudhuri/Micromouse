# Micromouse Maze Solver Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of the Micromouse maze-solving algorithm, designed for autonomous navigation of a robotic mouse through a maze. The project demonstrates key techniques in robotics and pathfinding, including:
	•	Flood Fill Algorithm for efficient maze exploration and solving.
	•	Wall Following Strategies (left-hand and right-hand rule).
	•	Dead-end Detection to optimize navigation paths.
	•	Shortest Path Calculation for rapid completion of the maze once fully mapped.

The code is modular and can be adapted for simulation or deployment on a physical Micromouse robot. It is written in [language] and includes documentation, sample mazes, and test cases for easy integration and testing.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or adapt the implementation for your own projects!
